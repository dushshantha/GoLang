## First Go Program 
This is the traditional "Hello, World!" with Go. No learning a new language without it, right? So, here you go.

You can run the programs by using the the go command below

```
go run <filename>
```

You can also compile the code into an executable by using:
```python
go build <filename>
```
This will create an executable file depending on your OS which you can run standalone.
